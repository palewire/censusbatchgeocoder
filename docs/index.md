# censusbatchgeocoder

A simple Python wrapper for the [U.S. Census Geocoding Services API batch service](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3894452-Census-Geocoding-Services-API.html)

```{contents} Table of contents

```

## Installation

```bash
pipenv install censusbatchgeocoder
```

## Basic usage

Importing the library

```python
import censusbatchgeocoder
```

According to the [official Census documentation](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3894452-Census-Geocoding-Services-API.html), the input is expected to contain the following fields:

* ``id``: Your unique identifier for the record
* ``address``: Structure number and street name (required)
* ``city``: City name (required)
* ``state``: State (optional)
* ``zipcode``: ZIP Code (optional)

You can geocode a comma-delimited file from the filesystem. Results are returned as a list of dictionaries.

An example could look like this:

```text
id,address,city,state,zipcode
1,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington,DC,20006
2,202 W. 1st Street,Los Angeles,CA,90012
```

Which is then passed in like this:

```python
results = censusbatchgeocoder.geocode("./my_file.csv")
```

The results are returned with the following columns from the Census

* ``id``: The unique id provided with the record.
* ``returned_address``: The address that was submitted to the geocoder.
* ``geocoded_address``: The address of the match returned by the geocoder.
* ``is_match``: Whether or not the geocoder found a match.
* ``is_exact``: The precision of the match.
* ``coordinates``: The longitude and latitude of the match together in a string.
* ``longitude``: The longitude of the match as a float.
* ``latitude``: The latitude of the match as a float.
* ``tiger_line``: The Census TIGER line of the match.
* ``side``: The side of the Census TIGER line of the match.
* ``state_fips``: The FIPS state code identifying the state of the match.
* ``county_fips``: The FIPS county code identifying the county of the match.
* ``tract``: The Census tract of the match.
* ``block``: The Census block of the match.

```python
print(results)

    {
        "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW",
        "block": "1031",
        "city": "Washington",
        "coordinates": "-77.03535,38.898754",
        "county_fips": "001",
        "geocoded_address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC, 20006",
        "id": "1",
        "is_exact": "Non_Exact",
        "is_match": "Match",
        "latitude": 38.898754,
        "longitude": -77.03535,
        "returned_address": "1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC, 20502",
        "side": "L",
        "state": "DC",
        "state_fips": "11",
        "tiger_line": "76225813",
        "tract": "006202",
        "zipcode": "20006",
    },
    {
        "address": "202 W. 1st Street",
        "block": "1034",
        "city": "Los Angeles",
        "coordinates": "-118.24456,34.053005",
        "county_fips": "037",
        "geocoded_address": "202 W. 1st Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90012",
        "id": "2",
        "is_exact": "Exact",
        "is_match": "Match",
        "latitude": 34.053005,
        "longitude": -118.24456,
        "returned_address": "202 W 1ST ST, LOS ANGELES, CA, 90012",
        "side": "L",
        "state": "CA",
        "state_fips": "06",
        "tiger_line": "141618115",
        "tract": "207400",
        "zipcode": "90012",
    },
]
```

Any extra metadata fields included in the file are still present in the returned data.

So the ``my_metadata`` column here...

```text
id,address,city,state,zipcode,my_metadata
1,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington,DC,20006,foo
2,202 W. 1st Street,Los Angeles,CA,90012,bar
```

.. is still there after you geocode.

```python
censusbatchgeocoder.geocode("./my_file.csv")
[
    {
        "address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW",
        "block": "1031",
        "city": "Washington",
        "coordinates": "-77.03535,38.898754",
        "county_fips": "001",
        "geocoded_address": "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC, 20006",
        "id": "1",
        "is_exact": "Non_Exact",
        "is_match": "Match",
        "latitude": 38.898754,
        "longitude": -77.03535,
        "returned_address": "1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC, 20502",
        "my_metadata": "foo",
        "side": "L",
        "state": "DC",
        "state_fips": "11",
        "tiger_line": "76225813",
        "tract": "006202",
        "zipcode": "20006",
    },
    {
        "address": "202 W. 1st Street",
        "block": "1034",
        "city": "Los Angeles",
        "coordinates": "-118.24456,34.053005",
        "county_fips": "037",
        "geocoded_address": "202 W. 1st Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90012",
        "id": "2",
        "is_exact": "Exact",
        "is_match": "Match",
        "latitude": 34.053005,
        "longitude": -118.24456,
        "returned_address": "202 W 1ST ST, LOS ANGELES, CA, 90012",
        "my_metadata": "foo",
        "side": "L",
        "state": "CA",
        "state_fips": "06",
        "tiger_line": "141618115",
        "tract": "207400",
        "zipcode": "90012",
    },
]
```

### Custom column names

If you have column headers that do not exactly match those expected by the geocoder you should override them.

So a file like this:

```text
foo,bar,baz,bada,boom
1,521 SWARTHMORE AVENUE,PACIFIC PALISADES,CA,90272-4350
2,2015 W TEMPLE STREET,LOS ANGELES,CA,90026-4913
```

Can be mapped like this:

```python
censusbatchgeocoder.geocode(
    self.weird_path, id="foo", address="bar", city="baz", state="bada", zipcode="boom"
)
```

### Optional columns

The state and ZIP Code columns are optional. If your data doesn't have them, pass ``None`` as keyword arguments.

```python
censusbatchgeocoder.geocode("./my_file.csv", state=None, zipcode=None)
```

### Lists of dictionaries

A list of dictionaries, like those created by the csv module's ``DictReader`` can also be mapped.

```python
my_list = [
    {
        "address": "521 SWARTHMORE AVENUE",
        "city": "PACIFIC PALISADES",
        "id": "1",
        "state": "CA",
        "zipcode": "90272-4350",
    },
    {
        "address": "2015 W TEMPLE STREET",
        "city": "LOS ANGELES",
        "id": "2",
        "state": "CA",
        "zipcode": "90026-4913",
    },
]
censusbatchgeocoder.geocode(my_list)
```

### pandas DataFrames

You can geocode a pandas DataFrame by converting it into a list of dictionaries.

```python
result = censusbatchgeocoder.geocode(df.to_dict("records"))
```

Then convert it back into a DataFrame.

```python
result_df = pd.DataFrame(result)
```

That's it.

### File objects

You can also geocode an in-memory file object of data in CSV format.

```python
my_data = """id,address,city,state,zipcode
1,1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW,Washington,DC,20006
2,202 W. 1st Street,Los Angeles,CA,90012"""
censusbatchgeocoder.geocode(io.StringIO(my_data))
```

### Different encodings

If you are using Python 2 and your CSV file has an unusual encoding that's causing problems, try explicitly passing in the encoding name.

```python
censusbatchgeocoder.geocode("./my_file.csv", encoding="utf-8-sig")
```
